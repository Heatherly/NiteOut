__A search web application that provides local events, restaurants, deals and a weather forecast for specified locations and time periods.__

This team project utilizes APIs such as Eventful, Groupon, Wunderground, and OpenTable. The front-end framework used is Materilze and Firebase database for the User Comments.

### How it Works
To begin, enter your desired city and state (the date is optional). Then select from the dropdown menus the type of events and the type of restaurants you are searching for. Click `Search` and your local results will be displayed along with a 5-day weather forecast.

At the bottom of the web app is a section where you may leave a comment, as well as few previous users' feedback.
